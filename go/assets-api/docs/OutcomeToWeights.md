## Methods

### NewOutcomeToWeights

`func NewOutcomeToWeights(outcomesToWeights map[string]float32, ) *OutcomeToWeights`

NewOutcomeToWeights instantiates a new OutcomeToWeights object
This constructor will assign default values to properties that have it defined,
and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewOutcomeToWeightsWithDefaults

`func NewOutcomeToWeightsWithDefaults() *OutcomeToWeights`

NewOutcomeToWeightsWithDefaults instantiates a new OutcomeToWeights object
This constructor will only assign default values to properties that have it defined,
but it doesn't guarantee that properties required by API are set

### GetOutcomesToWeights

`func (o *OutcomeToWeights) GetOutcomesToWeights() map[string]float32`

GetOutcomesToWeights returns the OutcomesToWeights field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetOutcomesToWeightsOk

`func (o *OutcomeToWeights) GetOutcomesToWeightsOk() (*map[string]float32, bool)`

GetOutcomesToWeightsOk returns a tuple with the OutcomesToWeights field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetOutcomesToWeights

`func (o *OutcomeToWeights) SetOutcomesToWeights(v map[string]float32)`

SetOutcomesToWeights sets OutcomesToWeights field to given value.
