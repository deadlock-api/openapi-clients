# **heroSynergiesStats**
> Array<HeroSynergyStats> heroSynergiesStats()

 Retrieves hero pair synergy statistics based on historical match data.  This endpoint analyzes completed matches to calculate how often a specific pair of heroes (`hero_id1` and `hero_id2`) won when playing *together on the same team*, and the total number of times they have played together under the specified filter conditions.  Results are cached for **1 hour** based on the combination of query parameters provided. Subsequent identical requests within this timeframe will receive the cached response.  ### Rate Limits: | Type | Limit | | ---- | ----- | | IP | 100req/s | | Key | - | | Global | - |

# **playerStatsMetrics**
> { [key: string]: HashMapValue; } playerStatsMetrics()

 Returns comprehensive statistical analysis of player performance.  Results are cached for **1 hour** based on the unique combination of query parameters provided. Subsequent identical requests within this timeframe will receive the cached response.  > Note: Quantiles are calculated using the [DDSketch](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol12/p2195-masson.pdf) algorithm, so they are not exact but have a maximum relative error of 0.01.  ### Rate Limits: | Type | Limit | | ---- | ----- | | IP | 100req/s | | Key | - | | Global | - |
