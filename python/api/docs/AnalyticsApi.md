Hero Counter Stats


Retrieves hero-versus-hero matchup statistics based on historical match data.

This endpoint analyzes completed matches to calculate how often a specific hero (`hero_id`) wins against an enemy hero (`enemy_hero_id`) and the total number of times they have faced each other under the specified filter conditions.

Results are cached for **1 hour** based on the combination of query parameters provided. Subsequent identical requests within this timeframe will receive the cached response.

Hero Synergy Stats


Retrieves hero pair synergy statistics based on historical match data.

This endpoint analyzes completed matches to calculate how often a specific pair of heroes (`hero_id1` and `hero_id2`) won when playing *together on the same team*, and the total number of times they have played together under the specified filter conditions.

Results are cached for **1 hour** based on the combination of query parameters provided. Subsequent identical requests within this timeframe will receive the cached response.
